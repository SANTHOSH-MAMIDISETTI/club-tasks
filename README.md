## task 1

A web scraping script was developed to extract data from a website, utilizing the BeautifulSoup, requests, and pandas libraries. The script first used the requests library to send a request to the website to check its status. Then, BeautifulSoup was utilized to scrape the necessary data from the website. Finally, pandas was employed to store the scraped data in a CSV file. The primary challenge faced during the development of this script was identifying the appropriate class and div elements of the targeted table.

## task 2

A basic level captcha automation script was developed using the Pytesseract, pillow, and OpenCV libraries. The script takes an input image, converts it into text using the mentioned libraries, and pytesseract library specifically. The primary challenge encountered during the development of this script was determining the optimal combination of psm and oem values for the specific image being used. This script can handle basic level captchas, however, significant improvements would be required to effectively utilize it against more complex captchas.

## task 3

I started playing Bandit, a series of Linux-based challenges on the OverTheWire wargames website, designed to teach basic Linux commands and system navigation. In each level, I had to log in using SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, providing the username "banditX" where X is the level number and the password from the previous level as the password.

In level 0, I logged in using the username "bandit0" and the password "bandit0".

In level 1, I logged in using the username "bandit1" and the password "bandit0", and then using the command cat readme I found the password for the next level in the file "readme" in the home directory.

In level 2, I logged in using the username "bandit2" and the password from the previous level, then using the command cat ./-, I found the password for the next level in the file "-" in the home directory.

In level 3,  the pasword is in a file whith blanks in the name  hence I did cat "file name with spaces" to read fiile and copy the passowrd.

In level 4 , the password is in a hidden file in the inhere directory, hence I used la to list all files including hidden files and then cat .hidden to read the file and copy the password.

In level 5, the password is in a file in the inhere directory, but it needs to be human readable, hence I used file ./* to  the type of data in the file and opened that one with ASCII in it.

In level 6, the password is in a file in the inhere directory, with many sub directories hence I searched the file with the given parameters by

``find . -type f -readable -size 1033c ! -executable``
and found the file and opened it with cat.

In level 7, the password is in a file somewhere on the server and just like the previous level  it too had pareamters to search with.

``find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c | grep -w password``

the I cat the destiantion file and copied the password.

In level 8, the password is in a large file and agnist the words "millionth" hence I used grep to search for the word and copied the password.
``cat data.txt | grep millionth``

In level 9  , the password is in data.txt but it's an unique value , hence I used

``cat data.txt | sort | uniq -c -u``

In level 10 , the password is in a file with a lot of text and the word "===" is repeated only once hence I used grep to search for the word and copied the password.
``strings data.txt | grep ===``

In level 11, the password is in a file which as data encoded in base 64 , hence i used ``cat data.txt | base64 --decode`` to decode the data and copied the password.

## task 9

As a beginner in web development, this was my first experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although the task did not specifically require the use of JavaScript, I chose to incorporate it in order to gain a better understanding of the basics. Overall, the experience was highly informative and beneficial to my learning progress. Just did it in LocalHost. didn't host it.
