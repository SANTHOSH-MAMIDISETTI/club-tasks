## task 1
This is a smiple web scraper which scrapes the data from the website and stores it in a csv file done mainly using beautifulsoup , requests & pandas. First requests library was used to send request to check the status of the website and then beautifulsoup was used to scrape the data from the website and then pandas was used to store the data in a csv file . The major difficulty I faced was in finding the class and div element of the table I needed . 

## task 2
This is a basic level captcha automator which takes input image and converts it into text using pytesseract , pillow and opencv . The major difficulty I faced was in finding the correct psm and oem combination values for the image I was using . This can do some basic level stuff , needs great deal of improvement if has to be used agnist complex captchas. 

## task 3
This is a basic level bandit game which is a game of levels . Each level has a password which is used to unlock the next level . I solved it the first time when I applied to bi0s , hence not a big deal .
